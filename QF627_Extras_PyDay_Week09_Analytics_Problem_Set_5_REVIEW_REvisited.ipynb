    "> Hi Team! üëã\n",
    "\n",
    "> To support your learning progress, I‚Äôve been closely observing your submissions and your participation in the problem-solving leadership sessions. Based on these observations, I find it would be beneficial for you to revisit some of the econometric methods for causal inference. As such, I‚Äôve made a few revisions to the originally planned set of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Problem Set 5 now consists of three questions, and this time, you are required to first identify a valid econometric method appropriate for each problem before conducting your analysis. Of the three questions, two‚Äîspecifically the first and third‚Äîwill ask you to clearly specify your modeling strategy by determining which econometric method of causal inference is most suitable for solving the given analytics problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As we‚Äôve discussed in class, the central goal of our course is to develop your ability to solve real-world problems using analytics. To support your reasoning in selecting appropriate modeling strategies, I‚Äôve provided a function we‚Äôve reviewed multiple times in class. Please use this function to help determine the most suitable econometric method for each question.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Once you‚Äôve identified your approach, proceed to answer each question by applying the method to assess the causal effects of interest, drawing on the knowledge you‚Äôve acquired throughout the course.\n",

The plan was to compare the engagement scores of employees whose managers were enrolled in the program with those whose managers were not. With proper randomization, this simple comparison would provide the average treatment effect of the training.\n",
